## String Art: Privacy Policy

Welcome to String Art!

This is an application that uses Artistic String algorithm developed by KThinking and this application is also available on store.

Features: Monochrome, multicolor and dark mode The application requires access to images for painting

If you choose not to read this entire Privacy Policy, we would like you to review some key points about String Art's privacy practices:

We do not use the images you provide when you use the Application for any reason other than to provide you with the editing functionality of the Application.

We use a third-party cloud service provider — specifically Google Cloud Platform — to process and edit images.

Video is temporarily stored on cloud servers during editing and is encrypted with a key stored locally on your mobile device.

The video will be deleted immediately after the editing process is complete.

If you have any questions about how the app protects your privacy, please email me and I will definitely try to fix/help you.
